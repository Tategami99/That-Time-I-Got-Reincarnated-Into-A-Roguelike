# That Time I Got Reincarnated Into A Rougelike
Yes. That is the name of this game. If you look at my early revisions of this project you'll notice that my code makes you want to die.
However, that is because at the time of starting this project I was completely new to the libgdx game framework and somewhat new to Java as a whole.
I started this project for a competition between me and my friend. We were supposed to make a game within about 2-3 weeks or so based on the themes "dungeon" and "going up."
I originally wasn't planning on making a readme for this project but if I'm still working on this even after the competition between my friend and I then I believe this will be necessary.
