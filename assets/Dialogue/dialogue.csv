player,Where am I? Who are you?
Goddess,You died in a car crash and now you're here with a goddess such as myself. Although in a few minutes I'll be sending you to a new world.
player,So... I'm being Isekai'd?
Goddess,Basically. You'll be reincarnated into a world you'd typically find in a rougelike.
player,So if I die that will be it?
Goddess,Pretty much.
player,Do I get special abilities since I'm being reincarnated? I'd like to be a skilled archer in this new world because I did archery in my past life.
Goddess,Fine.
end,end
